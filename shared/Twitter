It does NOT:
~ make you a failure
~ make you a bad writer
~ mean you're a quitter 

It makes you strong! You've written a story that you're proud of. Don't let ANYONE take that away from you!

Ecstatic to say my debut novella is now published on Amazon! :) Can a forgotten daughter help her father to remember her using music? https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07N66XP33  #selfpublishing #ampublished #indieauthors #WritingCommunity #IndieBooksBeSeen #BookBoostAfter near 8yrs of doing it all myself #selfPublishing, I have to say that its fab awesome having a publisher now. So good to have the excellent team at OneTree House Press repping my Telesa books & actively working for more author opps. It frees me up to write more. I like this.PRO TIP:
One effective digital marketing strategy for indie authors is to hire bears to do your marketing for you.
